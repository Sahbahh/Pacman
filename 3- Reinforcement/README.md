Part 3 of SFU CMPT310 project
------------------------------------------
My answers are in <br />
• **valueIterationAgents.py** → A value iteration agent for solving known MDPs.<br />
• **qlearningAgents.py** → Q-learning agents for Gridworld, Crawler and Pacman.<br />
• **analysis.py** → A file to put your answers to questions given in the project.<br />


**Introduction:**<br />
In this project, you will implement value iteration and Q-learning. You will test your
agents first on Gridworld, then apply them to a simulated robot controller (Crawler)
and Pacman.
