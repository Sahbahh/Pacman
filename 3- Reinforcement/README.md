------------------------------------------
My answers are in <br />
• **valueIterationAgents.py** → A value iteration agent for solving known MDPs.<br />
• **qlearningAgents.py** → Q-learning agents for Gridworld, Crawler and Pacman.<br />
• **analysis.py** → A file to put your answers to questions given in the project.<br />


**Introduction:**<br />
In this project, your Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach
a particular location and to collect food efficiently. You will build general search algorithms
and apply them to Pacman scenarios.
